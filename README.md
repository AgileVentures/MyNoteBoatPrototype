# MyNoteBoatPrototype
React-Native design sprint prototype for the [MyNoteBoat project](http://www.mynoteboat.fr/)

We ran a full week design sprint for the MyNoteBoat folks, running usability studies with French sailors at the end of the week.  The client was insistent that we needed to have an actual app to test rather than a demo involving Marvel or InVision or similar and so we used [ReactNative](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [expo](https://expo.io/) to prototype the app super fast and deliver it so that it would work on the client's android phone.  The system created was rather hacky and does not work well on iOS or look very good on android screen resolutions other than 800 x 480.

The feedback from the client and the French sailors was very positive and we look forward to developing the production version of the system.
